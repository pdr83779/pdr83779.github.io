Happiness, in my opinion, is an emotion of constant joy and comfort. It brings
 peace within and allows for you to live life with a smile. You can find happiness 
 in certain aspects of life but to be genuinely happy, you must find happiness within
 yourself. Pure happiness is to be content with your life. You are able to conquer any 
 obstacle life throws your way with strength and grace. You are capable of overcoming 
 anything because you know your strengths and weaknesses and how to use them to your 
 advantage. To be purely happy is to know who you are and take measures to accommodate
 to your needs as a healthy and joyful human being.

	Throughout the years, I struggled to find happiness from within. Pure happiness 
	became such a mythical topic to me. Getting out of bed in the morning was my biggest 
	struggle. Some days, the thought of smiling just seemed so bizarre and far-fetched. 
	I lived life bad day after bad day until I just couldn’t handle it anymore. After putting 
	on a fake smile to my peers for so many years, I finally accepted my flaws 
	and decided to change my life drastically in order to accommodate my mental needs.

	Beginning my new regime of happiness, I first began to eat healthy. Eating healthy 
	is more than just beneficial for your physical health but it is also beneficial for
	your mental health. A healthy body produces a healthy mindset. Next, I began to exercise
	frequently. I did yoga every week in hopes of it bringing happiness to my life. The weekly 
	yoga sessions motivated me to participate in daily meditation practices. Every day 
	when I wake up, I meditate for 10 minutes in order to start my day with a happy and
	fresh outlook. Another thing I do is SMILE! Smiling even when you are in a bad mood
	helps uplift your attitude. It brings joy to the situation and thus bringing more
	happiness to the table! I also realized that always being positive increases overall 
	happiness. If you are having a bad day, think about something good that happened! 
	Dropped your ice cream? It’s okay! Ice cream has tons of sugar and is very unhealthy
	for your body anyways! Failed a test? It is okay! You are a happy and healthy human 
	being and you should be grateful that you are even able to pursue a collegiate education! 
	On this journey of happiness, I realized that I can only do so much. I can change my 
	daily habit in order to produce more happiness but I also must surround myself
	with those who uplift me. A big key to being happy is to have friends who are happy and positive.
